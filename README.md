# sorting-algorithms-comparison
A program that sorts a list from a file and compares 6 different sorting algorithms in terms  of their processing time.
# CSE701 Project Draft 
Note: This is not a documentation but a quick summary of my program 

## Overview 
This program sorts a list from a file and compares the sorting algorithms mentioned below in terms of their time while providing time statistics.
* Bubble Sort
* Selection Sort
* Quick Sort
* Insertion Sort
* Merge Sort 
* Heap Sort
  
## What can this program do 
* sort a list from a file given from a user and printing it in an output file 
* provide a report comparing the 6 different algorithm in terms of average, median, standard deviation, min and max of the processing time and printing it in an output file.
* sort based on the user choice of algorithm and printing it in the console 
* providing a specific statistics metric from the ones mentioned above 

## Classes
There are three classes developed in this program 

1. run-time class -> used to calculate the run time of a chunk of code 
2. sorter class -> used to sort a vector based on the choice of algorithm, print it in consol, and print sorted array in an output file.
3. statistics class -> runs sorting algorithms 100 times then provided a specific run time statistic for an algorithm and provide an algorithms comparison report.
